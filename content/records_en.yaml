    THE USER<br>
    INTERFACE

    To be honest and I&#39;d be speaking like from where I&#39;m standing and maybe my generation, I think 80 percent
    of it is already lost and we are struggling to keep the 20 percent that&#39;s there.<br>

    A phone has a lot of structure inside. A lot of chips connected to one another. A lot of integral circuits, a lot
    of mechanics inside that makes a phone what it is. When you look at a phone you don&#39;t see all that stuff
    inside. You look at the cover. Yeah, this the touch screen. You can see where to add volume or where
    to reduce volume. You can see the On and Off. You can fingerprint the camera, the output stuff. And that&#39;s
    the 20 percent that&#39;s left here right now. It&#39;s the output stuff.<br>

    The things that people would show off. Dance, Imigongo. Not the integral circuit. Not the motherboard. All
    the essential parts that would make the output device multiply. No. We just have... It&#39;s like just cutting the
    roots of a tree and giving you the tree. Maybe someone would find a way to sustain it and make it turn it
    into a plastic thing that would stay there. But it will never grow again. You see? It will never grow again. It
    will never have new fruits. It will always be what it is now. I think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening also with the
    dance. Because nobody learned how to make them. They all learned the dances but nobody learned how
    to create them.

    THE KINGS<br>
    WAGER
  subtitle: with Chris Schwagga

    I think music from Congo. Rumba. Congolese Rumba specifically. Old school Congolese Rumba
    affects me. It brings something out of me. More than anything else.<br>

    And you also have traditional music from the region I come from. It has a lot of percussion and a
    lot of the small Karimba. It has this melancholy to it. In the songs people are sharing stories. Or
    telling a story from a past King or telling a story from a legend, from one family.<br>

    So you listen to the story but you connect the story with the instrument, to the sound. And then it,
    kind of, puts you in a certain mood and it brings you back as well. Yes, I remember songs. I
    remember some... There was one about a king who gave a challenge to boys of his kingdom. The
    one wants to marry his daughter. He is going to have to bring him water from a specific river in
    his hands. And the one who&#39;s going to be able to do, it is the one who&#39;s going to marry his
    daughter. And then you had all the men, all the young man, the warriors, trying to carry the water
    which was like kilometers away from where the king was. And you had one that wasn&#39;t the
    strongest, but he was smart. And he went to the King and said: You gave us the challenge. But as
    men of your kingdom let us also give you a challenge. You&#39;re a great king. If you want me to bring
    you water in my hands please show me how to make a knot with smoke. And it forced the king to
    reflect. And he was like: that&#39;s what I needed! I needed a challenge. I didn&#39;t need someone to do
    exactly what I wanted, but I needed someone who was gonna challenge me. Someone smart.
    Who&#39;s going to launch back the ball to me. And he was the one who married the daughter.

    THE CROWD<br>
    IS HARDLY<br>
    BREATHING
  subtitle: with Hervé Kimenyi
  duration: 2’37’’

    It&#39;s when you realize it&#39;s not about you. It is when you let the story unveil itself. So,
    it&#39;s a level of connection that you have with your characters or your theme or your
    story, that makes that you don&#39;t even realize you&#39;re performing. You&#39;re not thinking
    about it. It just flows. It&#39;s just happening. Or it&#39;s like a heartbeat: You don&#39;t have to
    tell you your heart to go boom boom boom. It just goes. So sometimes the story is
    alive just by itself. Just like that. You can hardly hear the crowd breathing. They are
    all like ahh.. You can hear that moment. You can feel it when people can’t
    even move because they don&#39;t want..... They won’t break the story. They&#39;re just
    like... puh... They don&#39;t see you. They see the story. Because if it’s told right they
    see themselves in that story. <br>
    And Time? Time becomes irrelevant, completely irrelevant. My best performances: I
    would get on stage. And next thing I know I&#39;m saying the words of the last
    paragraph. I&#39;m like: “Oh. Oh. Oh we&#39;re done.” And that&#39;s how it ends. Your brain
    doesn&#39;t remember you performed. Your body does because you&#39;re exhausted. But
    it&#39;s really when you become not the… not Hervé performing but you become like a
    vessel for something bigger than you. And you let it just happen.

    THE LEGEND<br>

    RUGOMBITURI

    Once upon a time there was a king named Rwogera. One day as he toured the
    country enjoying the beauty of the hills, escorted by his servants, he came across a
    kid lost in the bush. The kid had a long neck, veins showing on his forehead, tiny
    legs like a bird, a flat behind that looked like an extension of the back... so long it
    seemed as if the kid had a tail. King Rwogera ordered on of his servants to take the
    kid and look after him or else he would lose all his privileges if the kid died. The
    servant took the boy and tried to feed him but he refused to drink milk. He tried
    yoghurt, the boy refused to drink it. The servant took the kid into his arms, sang
    lullabies for the kid and kindly asked, &quot;What do you want kiddo?&quot; The kid said &quot;I
    want Ituri.&quot; Everyone was confused about what Ituri is. An old man who was
    smoking tobacco nearby told them &quot;I know what Ituri is. Go get some sweet
    potatoes and cook them together with beans. Add some isogi greens and boil
    everything together.&quot; When the food was ready and served, the little boy&#39;s mouth
    watered. His eyes lit with excitement as he got close to the food. As soon as he
    finished his plate, he drank the milk. From then on he was nicknamed Rugombituri
    [He who must have his ituri.] After a few days, the kid began to gain a bit of skin on
    his bones. The boy grew up into a man, married and had a son. He was named
    Bisangwa. Bisangwa was Rwabugiri&#39;s age mate and together with Inshozamihigo
    and other boys, they were members of the Ingangurarugo army. They fought in
    Ndorwa and Bunyabungo. At the death of Rwogera, Rwabugiri became king and
    stayed friends with Bisangwa. One day as Rwabugiri walked past kids playing in the
    street, he stopped to talk to them but the kids took off. He insisted that they don&#39;t
    run. They eventually came back. Then he asked, &quot;why did you run away when you
    saw me?&quot; The kids said, &quot;rumour has it that you kill people.&quot; The king got so sad
    and said, &quot;I only kill bad people that chiefs bring to me.&quot; Later on, Rwabugiri
    summoned all his chiefs. The highest in rank was Bisangwa. He offered them
    prestigious banana beer to drink but insisted that only the chief who has never
    wronged another should sip on it. None of the chiefs dared drink. When Bisangwa
    stepped into the room, he was shocked by the scene of men sitting around a pot of
    alcohol without touching it. Rwabugiri explained to Bisangwa what happened.
    Bisangwa broke into a self-praise poem saying he was righteous and had no
    reason to fear the drink. Bisangwa sipped on the drink. All the chiefs clapped for
    him.&quot; That&#39;s the legend of Bisangwa, son of Bigombituri.<br>

    I love this story because it holds stories of the past. This is also so the youth can
    learn about their past. I think the future is bright. I went to primary school. We only
    studied in French. No English. But today, kids speak English, French, some Swahili.
    I think it&#39;s a very good step forward.

    THE ROUTE<br>
    DESCRIPTION

    If you ask my mom to tell you where we live she would go like, &#39;Urabona ugeze
    hariya i Kanombe ku rusengero rwa Manishoborabyose urakata i bumoso,
    urahasanga umudamu ucuruza amandazi...&#39; That would be like, you know, when
    you go, you&#39;ll find a church that is called... Then you&#39;ll find a lady that sells
    something on the street and then you turn on your left and then go down and then
    turn on your right and then you&#39;ll see a big tree and then behind that tree you&#39;ll see
    the road that goes home. That will be her way of describing. But everybody here
    now would say... A kid I asked, you know, I don&#39;t know where you live. And then
    she said to me, &#39;code: KN 5 Rd, Avenue bla bla&#39; So what am I supposed to do with
    this information. I won&#39;t go to the motel and say, you know, &#39;KN bla bla&#39; No. They
    won&#39;t get it. So, how am I supposed to issue a place. But the kids are
    comfortable these days. They would just want you to put it on your Google and then
    you see the full map and then you do Google map. And that&#39;s typical. It&#39;s what we
    see in movies. That&#39;s American. And that&#39;s, you know, Western. And everything
    else is going that same way. People used to sit in the living room and watch TV.
    Now every kid has Netflix on their iPhones.

    I&#39;ve been collecting songs. Songs that are regarded as poems, stories about love.
    They are songs of praise about places, about the fall of the king, about the queen.
    Folk songs, wedding songs. There are researches on tonality, on rhythms, almost
    30 pieces. And recently I had the luck to meet young people, young Rwandans,
    who are also enthusiastic about it! See here, the notation of the old songs.
    Because there are some young people, e.g. in the United States, who are not
    interested in all this and who want to destroy it all!
    But that will stay! I bet 1000 dollars on that!<br>
    So even now I&#39;m a dancer, I&#39;m a professional dancer. But when it comes to
    Umihamirizo, I would do only the dance part. You imagine... Let me give you a joke
    for example. When the men are dancing at the end of Turivuga? Do you know what
    I do, by then? I could either just scream or say Guma Guma Guma. Or I
    would count, ‘rimwe kabiri gatatu kane gatanu gatandatu karindwi umunani ikenda
    icumi’ And it would work. Because nobody would understand what I&#39;m saying.
    Or even say a prayer, ‘Je vous salue, Marie plaine de grâce...’ in Kinyarwanda,
    right? Or even, ‘da uri mw&#39;ijuru izina ryawe’ That&#39;s how I go out with that. And
    people wouldn&#39;t understand, like if I&#39;m dancing for people that would not take
    that time to listen. I&#39;m not the only one. Because there would be others in front
    saying the right words for them, you know, stuff that they&#39;ve learnt. But now
    for example me that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say. I&#39;ll avoid the subject completely.

    THE QUEEN<br>
    GETS HERSELF<br>
    A LOVER
  subtitle: with Eric 1key
  duration: 1’25’’
  text: >
    The Story of the Queen squirting the Lake Kivu is a legend, you know. So, here&#39;s
    how the legend goes: There&#39;s a queen. Her husband, the king or chef, we don&#39;t
    know who. But they...they say... The name of the Queen is Gukuna-Kunyaza. And
    it&#39;s funny because today it has become synonymous with making a girl squirt and
    with sex as well. This is like street language. And so the king is not there. And the
    queen is at home and she wants to have sex. And she calls the Mutwa. Mutwa are
    servants, you know... And she calls the servant to have sex with her and the
    servant is very scared because, like, okay if I say no I&#39;ll be killed. If I say yes and
    the husband finds me I&#39;m still getting killed. So in the middle of the confusion, he
    was really like, he was afraid, he was shaking literally and when he wanted to put
    the penis inside the vagina it couldn&#39;t work. So he was rubbing the penis on the
    clitoris and then she squirted. And apparently she squirted the Kivu lake. And that&#39;s
    the origin of how to make a woman...of the female ejaculation in Rwanda. That&#39;s
    what they say. That&#39;s the legend.

    THATS<br>
    COLONIZATION,<br>
    YOU STUPID!

    Humanism, the human trait. In former times this was described by the vocabulary
    &quot;ubuntu&quot;. Nowadays one says &quot;ubumuntu&quot;. What does that mean? It is a word
    creation. &quot;Ubuntu&quot; means human character, human quality. &quot;Ubumuntu&quot; has no
    meaning at all.<br>

    Whereas &quot;ubuntu&quot; is based on a philosophical approach. One could even say on a
    metaphysical approach. Etymologically everything that exists is called &quot;ntu&quot;. Not
    only in Rwanda, but generally in the Bantu language. Everything that exists is &quot;ntu&quot;.
    Like &quot;umu-ntu&quot; - for man. Things are &quot;iki-ntu&quot;.<br>

    The space: &quot;aha-ntu&quot;. The modality of a person, a thing, a space: &quot;uku-ntu&quot;. &quot;ubu-
    ntu&quot;. This is understood and used not only in Rwanda, but also in other countries
    like South Africa, as far as Mozambique, Gabon... And exactly this dimension is
    lost. Instead we use a word that no longer has any reference at all. &quot;Ubuntu&quot; is the
    human generosity that urges people to place themselves at the service of the
    community. This goes so far that the warriors accepted death in order to save the
    community, the country. It is the expression of the human in itself.<br>

    It becomes a mission for you to learn the language. Right? So well that no one can
    ever ever tell you ever again that you don&#39;t belong. So I went into that thing of
    learning Kinyarwanda with that mindset, you know. And then I got caught up
    because I realized that it&#39;s like that with languages. It comes from such a different
    place. The way we were talking about words being emotions and being also a way
    of seeing the world. Because your language is also the way you see the world, the
    way you relate to it, the way that it&#39;s formulated and everything. So, I
    just understood that I could never learn that.<br>

    When I speak French people ask me when I left France. When I was born in
    France? First time I went to France was like probably last year or two years ago.
    But you get there and they ask you, ‘So are you back? Because I don&#39;t see a stamp
    of you leaving.’ ‘I&#39;ve never been here before.’ ‘Really? Then how come you
    speak French like that?’ ‘Colonization, you stupid! It works!’ Like if it works!! So
    basically identity is made. Me right now I have a passport. I&#39;m Rwandan. I live here.
    My parents are from here. So that&#39;s my identity. But what about my origins? If I had
    to trace it back three, four, five generations behind me. You can do a DNA origin
    test these days. You&#39;re going to find the Asian blood. Like so. <br>

    I think that in the past years I&#39;ve been experiencing things that were like overly
    intense for me to handle with words. So that&#39;s why I stopped. And that&#39;s why I was
    like: You know what? This feeling makes me feel like screaming. So, a scream is
    maybe closer to what I would like to say about the situation.<br>

    The sociological anthropological dimension... how man realizes himself...
    Individualism was also Descartes&#39; theme: I - the Subject - I think, so I am. Western
    thinking is based on the subject, on individualism. In Rwanda the Community is
    crucial. The individual becomes a reality within a community. This is a very
    enriching thought. There are many in Rwanda, who died to protect the community.
    ...and save the world. The most important thing is that people can unfold.<br>

    When I&#39;m talking to Eric we speak French more than Kinyarwanda. Now we&#39;re trying
    to mix a little bit. It&#39;s coming. We have created our own language in Kigali which is a
    mix of French and English and Kinyarwanda. That&#39;s a futuristic invention. It&#39;s this
    language that doesn&#39;t have a barrier. You start in French you finish in Kinyarwanda
    then you put some Lingala into it and some Suhaeli and it&#39;s perfect. <br>

    And then now it&#39;s what we have invented. I mean like language is super powerful.
    And that&#39;s also one of the reasons why we&#39;re really have to work. It&#39;s the first way of
    decolonizing the mind, it&#39;s decolonizing the language. <br>

    It&#39;s what actually makes you a citizen of the world. Because we&#39;ve been taught
    since we&#39;re kids that Kinyarwanda is not good. It is for the natives, for the people in
    the village. Lingala, you know that&#39;s why we didn&#39;t even make an effort of learning it
    when we were outside. Why would I learn a language that&#39;s not going to serve me
    even if it&#39;s my own language?<br>

    I think Kinyarwanda is going to disappear and leave space to this beautiful migrated
    language that we are creating now. I really think it because even now, you know,
    finding someone who speaks a perfect Kinyarwanda, you really have to go to
    people that work in culture, that&#39;s Bavagurinya, people like Deo. People that grew
    up in this secular family, that transmitted the language the way it is. Or Karinganire
    and you know, things like this. But it&#39;s out there, even the president... If everybody is
    speaking this new futuristic language that is a French, Kinyarwanda, Suaheli,
    Lingala, Luganda mix of all the languages...
