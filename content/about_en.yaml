  ### RWANDAN RECORDS is a work of walkable musical theatre by Jens Dietrich and Milena
  Kipfmüller featuring artists from Rwanda and Germany. It combines pre-colonial accounts with
  stories from the present. It is a cross between live concert, radio play and installation that invites
  audience members to immerse themselves in the stories shared by Rwanda and Germany. The
  Rwandan hip-hop artist Eric 1key and the Berlin-based composer Klaus Janek have created a
  soundscape of language, traditional sounds, electronic music, beats and field recordings. ###


  ### Upon hearing the word Rwanda, most people probably think of the genocide that began 25
  years ago in April. There has been massive economic development since then. But Rwanda’s
  younger generation, like Germany’s, has to grapple with a difficult legacy. Crossing magnificent
  visions of the future with yearnings for dispersed traditions, Dietrich and Kipfmüller, the Rwandan
  spoken word artist Eric 1key and the Berlin-based composer Klaus Janek have developed
  “Rwandan Records” - a record label, sound studio, bar and archive of personal recollections. The
  project presents a new and unusual perspective on identity in a global context. In Rwanda and
  Germany, there is a similar interest in pop culture and the keywords used in public debate -
  identity, migration, community, integration, home, tradition and prosperity - are the same. But in
  Rwanda, they are associated with completely different visions and thus gain new, expanded
  meanings. ###


  ### After recording many conversations with many people in Rwanda, Dietrich and Kipfmüller
  have created a heterogeneous ensemble of voices. This work of walkable musical theatre is at
  once sound installation and radio play, concert and staged space, whose acoustic architecture is
  shaped by the audience. The composition moves between different times and worlds, between
  traditional songs, pop music and electronic sounds. The voices of the ensemble and its stories
  become a moving live symphony. A narrative that transcends genre and culture will emerge on
  the basis of a combination of different times, visions of the past and the future, as well as breaks
  in people’s biographies. ###
