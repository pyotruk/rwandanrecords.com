  RWANDAN RECORDS is a work of walkable musical theatre by Jens Dietrich and Milena Kipfmüller featuring artists from Rwanda and Germany. It combines pre-colonial accounts with stories from the present. It is a cross between live concert, radio play and installation that invites audience members to immerse themselves in the stories shared by Rwanda and Germany.
  <br>
  The Rwandan hip-hop artist Eric 1key and the Berlin-based composer Klaus Janek have created a soundscape of language, traditional sounds, electronic music, beats and field recordings. Crossing magnificent visions of the future with yearnings for dispersed traditions, the project gives new expanded meanings to keywords used in public debate like identity, migration, community, integration, home, tradition and prosperity.
  <br>
  After recording conversations with many people in Rwanda, Dietrich and Kipfmüller have created a heterogeneous ensemble of voices. A narrative that transcends genre and culture will emerge on the basis of a combination of different times, visions of the past and the future, as well as breaks in people’s biographies. The voices of the ensemble and its stories become a moving live symphony.
